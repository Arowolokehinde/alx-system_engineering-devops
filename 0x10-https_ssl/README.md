HTTPS SSL Roles:
Authentication:

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) helps in authenticating the identity of the website that you are connecting to. It ensures that the website is genuine and not an imposter.
Encryption:

SSL encrypts the data transmitted between the web server and the client, ensuring that the information remains secure and cannot be intercepted by malicious parties.
Purpose of Encrypting Traffic:
The primary purpose of encrypting traffic using SSL is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between the client and the server. This encryption prevents unauthorized parties from eavesdropping on sensitive information.
SSL Termination:
SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting SSL-encrypted data at the load balancer or reverse proxy, allowing it to inspect the traffic before forwarding it to the destination server. This process offloads the decryption workload from the server, improving performance and scalability.

# HTTPS SSL Overview

This repository covers key concepts related to HTTPS SSL and its importance in securing website traffic.

## HTTPS SSL Roles
1. **Authentication**:
   - SSL authenticates the identity of the website, ensuring it is legitimate.
2. **Encryption**:
   - SSL encrypts data exchanged between the server and client for security.

## Purpose of Encrypting Traffic
- Encryption ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity to prevent unauthorized access.

## SSL Termination
- SSL termination involves decrypting SSL-encrypted data at a load balancer or proxy for inspection before forwarding it to the server.

### Scripts
- The scripts in this repository demonstrate practical implementations of SSL termination using HAProxy.

### Resources
- Additional resources and references are provided for further learning.
