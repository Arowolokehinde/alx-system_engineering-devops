Networking Concepts README
This README file provides an overview of various networking concepts for reference.


OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and design computer networks. It consists of seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.


Types of Networks
LAN (Local Area Network): A network that covers a small geographical area, typically within a single building or campus.

WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that spans a larger geographical area, connecting LANs across cities or countries.

Internet: A global network that interconnects millions of networks worldwide, allowing communication and information exchange.


MAC Address
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface for communication on a network.


IP Address
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.


Private and Public Address
Private Address: Reserved IP addresses for use within a private network, not routable on the public internet.

Public Address: IP addresses assigned to devices that are directly accessible on the public internet.


IPv4 and IPv6
IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4, using 32-bit addresses.

IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6, using 128-bit addresses to overcome IPv4 limitations.


Localhost
The localhost refers to the current device used to access it. It is often associated with the loopback IP address (127.0.0.1).


TCP and UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.


UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Offers faster, connectionless communication but may result in data loss.


TCP/UDP Ports List
Commonly used ports:

FTP (20, 21)
SSH (22)
HTTP (80)
HTTPS (443)
DNS (53)
SMTP (25)
POP3 (110)
IMAP (143)


Ping/ICMP
Ping, based on ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), is a utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.


Positional Parameters
In the context of scripting or command-line interfaces, positional parameters refer to arguments passed to a script or command based on their position in the input.
