Understanding Web Servers and HTTP Requests

Main Role of a Web Server
A web server is a software application that serves web content to clients over the internet. Its primary role is to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients, such as web browsers, and provide the appropriate responses. These responses may include serving web pages, files, images, or executing server-side scripts. Web servers play a crucial role in facilitating the communication between clients and web applications or websites.

Child Process
In computing, a child process is a process that is created by another process, known as the parent process. Child processes inherit various attributes from their parent, such as environment variables and file descriptors. They operate independently and can perform tasks concurrently with the parent process or other child processes. Child processes are commonly used in multitasking and parallel processing environments to efficiently manage resources and workload distribution.

Why Web Servers Usually Have Parent and Child Processes
Web servers often utilize a parent-child process model to enhance performance, reliability, and scalability. Here's why they adopt this approach:

Concurrency: By spawning multiple child processes, web servers can handle multiple client requests simultaneously, thereby improving concurrency and responsiveness.
Fault Isolation: If one child process encounters an error or becomes unresponsive, it does not affect the entire server. Other child processes and the parent process can continue to function normally, enhancing fault tolerance.
Resource Management: Parent processes can oversee the creation, termination, and resource allocation of child processes. This helps in efficiently managing system resources and optimizing performance.
Load Balancing: Child processes can be distributed across multiple CPU cores or servers, enabling load balancing and scalability to accommodate varying levels of traffic.
Main HTTP Requests
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) defines several methods or HTTP requests that clients can use to communicate with web servers. Some of the main HTTP requests include:

GET: Requests data from a specified resource.
POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
PUT: Updates the specified resource with the provided data.
DELETE: Deletes the specified resource.
HEAD: Requests the headers of the specified resource without requesting the actual data.
OPTIONS: Requests information about the communication options available for the specified resource.
PATCH: Applies partial modifications to a resource.
These HTTP requests form the foundation of client-server communication in web applications, enabling various interactions and operations.
